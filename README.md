# L1LLPTag
Scripts and code used for the ongoing Level 1 LLP tagging project for CMS.


# Setting up Conda

Conda will need to be set up in order to run any of the scripts, including launching jupyter notebooks. On the directory of your choice, run the following commands:
<pre>
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

export PATH="$HOME/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"
conda config --set auto_activate_base false

</pre>

After installing conda, we need to set up a virtual environment containing the modules used in the scripts. To create, and subsequently, activate the virtual environment, run:

<pre>
conda env create -f environment.yml
</pre>

# Reconstructing Jets:

`$ Python3 DataF.py </path/to/file> (using xrootd or another access mode> QCDpt30 30 50 0`

Order is as follows:

path to file (using xrootd: `root://cmsxrootd.fnal.gov///store/...`)

tag = "QCDpt30" or "Stpt30" in this case.

ptCut = 30 (so, >30 GeV)

trainPercent = 50 (50 % training data)

usePuppi = 0 (0 for pf, 1 for PUPPI)

# Training:

Add paths of the training files resulting from DataForge.py.

# Removing Background Jets from Signal Sample: 

Use removeBackground.py. Input the .h5 files (test and train) generated by dataForge.py from signal sample.

# ROC Curves:

Inside ROC.py, add paths of the testing data resulting from the DataForge.py.
